## 5.1 Testing Plan

### Table 5.1.1 Software Component Requirements Testing

| Testing Type | Yes/No | Comments/Explanations | Software Component |
|-------------|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Unit        | Yes    | Critical for validating individual functions and algorithms such as key extraction, pattern matching, and file parsing | - Key Extraction Module (checker.py)<br>- Pattern Matching (regex patterns)<br>- File Parsing (JSON, Python, JS/TS, Vue) |
| Integration | Yes    | Required to ensure seamless interaction between modules (e.g., CLI interface ↔ Core engine ↔ Reporting) | - CLI ↔ Checker Engine<br>- File Scanner ↔ Report Generator<br>- JSON Parser ↔ Key Extractor |
| Performance | Yes    | Tool must process large codebases efficiently; tested with performance profiling tools | - Large Directory Scanning<br>- Regex Pattern Matching<br>- Report Generation |
| Stress      | Yes    | Must handle projects with thousands of translation keys and files without memory issues | - Memory Usage Optimization<br>- Processing Large JSON Files<br>- Handling Deeply Nested Keys |
| Compliance  | Yes    | Must support various i18n implementation patterns across frameworks and maintain compatibility | - Framework Support (React, Vue, Angular)<br>- Pattern Recognition<br>- Internationalization Standards |
| Load        | Yes    | Should maintain performance under high load conditions when integrated into CI/CD pipelines | - Concurrent Processing<br>- CI/CD Integration<br>- Batch Processing |
| Security    | Yes    | Must safely handle user code without introducing vulnerabilities or exposing sensitive data | - File Access Controls<br>- Input Validation<br>- Safe Pattern Matching |
| Volume      | Yes    | Tool should efficiently process high volumes of files and keys in enterprise-level applications | - Enterprise Codebase Support<br>- Multi-language Support<br>- Large-scale Report Generation |

## 5.2 CI/CD Integration Testing

### 5.2.1 CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The i18n-checker tool includes a robust CI/CD integration to ensure code quality, consistent performance, and reliable operation. The primary goal of the CI/CD pipeline is to automate testing and validation of the i18n-checker across multiple environments and use cases.

### 5.2.2 CI/CD Pipeline Components

| Component | Description | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Automated Testing | Runs unit and integration tests with each commit | GitHub Actions with pytest and pytest-cov |
| Code Quality Checking | Validates code against PEP 8 standards and common issues | flake8 static analysis |
| Multi-version Testing | Ensures compatibility with Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10 | Matrix testing strategy in GitHub Actions |
| Package Building | Validates that the package can be built correctly | Python build tools with GitHub Actions |
| Package Verification | Checks the built package for issues | twine check validation |
| Artifact Generation | Creates reports and documentation for review | Automated report generation |

### 5.2.3 CI/CD Testing Matrix

| Test Scenario | Expected Outcome | Validation Method |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Code Push to Repository | All tests run automatically | GitHub Actions logs |
| Failed Unit Test | Build marked as failed with error reports | GitHub Actions status checks |
| Successful Build | Package correctly built and validation passed | Build artifacts and status reports |
| Python Version Compatibility | Tool functions correctly across all supported Python versions | Matrix build results |
| Code Quality Issues | Warnings and errors reported for quality issues | flake8 output in logs |
| Package Build Issues | Build failures detected and reported | Build step logs |

### 5.2.4 CI/CD Integration Benefits for Testing

1. **Continuous Validation**: Every code change is automatically tested, ensuring immediate feedback on functionality
2. **Regression Prevention**: Prevents introduction of bugs that break existing functionality
3. **Consistent Quality**: Maintains code quality standards with automated linting and style checks
4. **Cross-version Compatibility**: Ensures the tool works across all supported Python versions
5. **Documentation Updates**: Validates that documentation remains accurate as the code evolves
6. **Integration Testing**: Confirms that all components work together correctly
