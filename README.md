## Project Title

#### i18n Key Management Tool: Detecting Unused and Missing Localization Keys Across Multiple Languages and Frameworks
## Project Overview

Localization is a critical aspect of modern software development, ensuring that applications support multiple languages. However, managing internationalization (i18n) keys can become complex as projects grow. Unused keys in translation files bloat the project, while missing keys can lead to broken or untranslated UI elements.

This project aims to develop a tool that efficiently detects: 

  `Unused Keys`: Keys present in the i18n JSON/YAML/PO files but not used in the codebase.
    
  `Missing Keys`: Keys referenced in the code but absent in the translation files.

Initially designed for Python projects, this tool will be expanded to support multiple programming languages and frameworks, making it highly versatile. Additionally, it will feature a CLI tool for developers and CI/CD integration to automate i18n validation in real-time during development workflows.
## Objectives


  - Multi-Language & Framework Support
        Extend support to JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, React, and HTML alongside Python.
        Allow parsing of different i18n file formats (.json, .po, .yaml, .ini).

  - Command-Line Interface (CLI) Tool
        Develop an easy-to-use CLI tool for scanning and reporting missing/unused i18n keys.
        Provide options for different output formats (console, JSON, Markdown).
        Implement an optional --fix flag to suggest or insert missing keys automatically.

  - CI/CD Integration
        Build a GitHub Action/GitLab pipeline to automate i18n validation in repositories.
        Allow developers to enforce localization best practices through automated checks.
        Generate structured reports that help maintain translation consistency.

### Expected Outcomes

  - A functional CLI tool capable of scanning and reporting unused and missing i18n keys.
  
  - Multi-language support for detecting localization inconsistencies across different programming frameworks.
  
  - Seamless CI/CD integration to help teams maintain i18n consistency in their projects.
